## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be edited at any time without notice.

Read the [Terms of Service](https://scoutant.org/leveling/terms-of-service).

### Information we collect

Leveling tracks when members send messages, join, leave voice channels, mute and deafen themselves.  
The bot can only track these events in the servers and channels it has access to.  
**It cannot access to the content of your messages** and to your oral conversations in voice channels.

These events allow Leveling to count the number of messages you have sent and the time you have spent in voice
channels.  
It decides if you are not really active in a voice channel: if you are alone, muted or deafened.

Leveling has access to the member list of every discord server it is in.  
It finally has access to usernames, server nicknames and member icons.

### Information we store

We store the following data: server ids, user ids, server names, usernames, url icons, levels, xp, number of messages
sent, active days, time spent in voice channels and the active time spent in voice channels.

### Data Usage

Leveling collects this data to give xp to members.  
It needs to store the nicknames and icons to generate leaderboards.

### How to delete my data?

Use the command `/reset-myself` to delete your data.

### How to disable the bot tracking?

Use the command `/privacy` and select the privacy mode `ghost`.

### Who can see my stats?

By default, everyone in a server can see your stats in this server.  
You can hide your stats by using the command `/privacy` and selecting the privacy mode `secret`.  
Note that you will no longer appear on the leaderboards.

### Data Expiration

To protect your privacy we cannot store your data indefinitely.

**Your stats in a specific server will be reset after 1 month of inactivity in that server.**  
You are considered inactive if you do not use any commands or buttons for 1 month.  
Please note that sending a message does not count as an activity.  
The stats of a server can also be reset if no member is active.

**Your data can be deleted without any reason and without warning.**  
Your data cannot be restored because it is deleted forever.
