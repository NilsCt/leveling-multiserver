### Availability and Proprietary Rights

Leveling is provided as-is.  
There are no guarantees that it will be available in the future.

Some features may be removed in the future.  
User data may be deleted at any time.

### Rules of conduct

You must follow the [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and
the [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).

Spamming the bot (sending interactions very quickly) is totally prohibited.  
You should not spam, stay afk in voice channels, exploit glitches and/or use a self-bot to earn xp.  
Server moderators have the right to add / remove / reset your xp without any reason.  
We are not responsible if a moderator has edited your xp.

### User Data

Read the [Privacy Policy](https://scoutant.org/leveling/privacy-policy).

To give members xp, Leveling needs to track the messages sent and the activity in voice channels.  
But **the bot does not have access to the content of your messages** and to your oral conversations.

Leveling need to store the following data: your id, username, icon, level, xp, number of sent messages, number of active
days in a server, time spent in voice channels and the active time spent in voice channels.

### Privacy

Your stats are by default visible to everyone but you can modify your privacy settings with `/privacy`.  
Note that you will no longer appear on the leaderboards.  
You can also disable the bot tracking with `/privacy`.  
You can reset your personal data with the command `/reset-myself`.

### Data Expiration

To protect your privacy we cannot store your data indefinitely.

**Your stats in a specific server will be reset after 1 month of inactivity in that server.**  
You are considered inactive if you do not use any commands or buttons for 1 month.  
Please note that sending a message does not count as an activity.  
The stats of a server can also be reset if no member is active.

**We have the right to reset your data without any reason and without warning you.**  
We can't restore old data as it is deleted forever.

### Billing

Leveling is a non-profit Discord Bot.  
We do not accept donations.
